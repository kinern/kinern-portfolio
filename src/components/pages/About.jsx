                            Hello! my name is Natalie. I am a Software Engineer living in the PNW.
                            Programming is something I have enjoyed doing for many years.
                            Recently I have been working as a Full Stack Web Developer.
                            I like collaborating with others on large software projects, but I also 
                            delve into solo projects from time to time.
                        </div>
                        <br />
                        <div>
                            My other creating outlet in my artwork, which I have been producing since I was a kid. 
                            I am accustomed to colored pencil and lineart, 
                            but I have also recently picked up watercolors painting.
                            You can see a glimpse of my artwork on my Instragram profile.
                            I enjoy drawing wildlife and natural landscapes.
                        </div>
                        <br />
                        <div>
                            Something people may not know about is my interest in Japanese 
                            language and culture. After I graduated university, I was an 
                            assistant language teacher for two years Southern Japan. 
                            I have fond memories of giving students English lessons and 
                            being a part of the community. 
                            I started learning Japanese in high school and hope to pass the 
                            N2 Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) at the end of 2021.
